```

## Commands

npm test; npm run test:watch; npm run test:coverage; npm run lint

## Code Style

TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 14.x (App Router with static export): Follow standard conventions
Testing: Use React Testing Library queries (getByRole, getByText), avoid test IDs, test user behavior not implementation

## Testing Patterns

- **Component Tests**: Co-located in `__tests__/` directories next to source files
- **File Naming**: Use `.test.tsx` for component tests, `.test.ts` for utility tests
- **Queries**: Prefer semantic queries (getByRole, getByLabelText) over test IDs
- **Mocking**: Use jest.mock() for Next.js modules (next/navigation, next/image)
- **Assertions**: Use @testing-library/jest-dom matchers (toBeInTheDocument, toHaveClass, etc.)
- **User Events**: Use userEvent.setup() and await user.click() for realistic interactions
- **Isolation**: Clear mocks in beforeEach hooks, no shared state between tests
- **Watch Mode**: Run npm run test:watch for continuous testing during development

## Pull Request Review Guidelines

When analyzing pull requests and generating PR summaries, follow these instructions:

### PR Summary Format

Generate a comprehensive PR summary with the following sections:

#### 1. **Overview**
- Brief description of what this PR accomplishes (1-2 sentences)
- Related issue/spec numbers if applicable

#### 2. **Changes Made**
Analyze the git diff and categorize changes:
- **New Features**: New functionality added
- **Bug Fixes**: Issues resolved
- **Refactoring**: Code improvements without functional changes
- **Tests**: New or updated tests
- **Documentation**: README, docs, or code comments
- **Configuration**: Config files, dependencies, or build setup
- **Breaking Changes**: Any backward-incompatible changes (⚠️ highlight these)

#### 3. **Impact Analysis**
- **Scope**: Which parts of the application are affected?
- **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High based on:
  - Complexity of changes
  - Number of files touched
  - Presence of tests
  - Breaking changes
- **Testing Coverage**: Are the changes adequately tested?

#### 4. **Review Checklist**
Generate a checklist based on the changes:
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly documented
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Performance implications considered

#### 5. **Recommendations**
- Specific areas to focus review attention on
- Potential concerns or questions for the author
- Suggestions for additional tests or documentation

### Output Format

Use clear Markdown with:
- Headers for each section
- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks for file paths or code snippets
- Emoji for visual clarity (✅ ⚠️ 🔒 🚀 📝 🧪)
- Tables for file impact analysis when appropriate
- Output the result as a markdown code block in the chat so it can be easily copied.
